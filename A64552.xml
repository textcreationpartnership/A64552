            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What I propoſe here is out of love and deſire to win ſoules to God, with my thankes for his goodneſs that hath raiſed up before me ſo many candles whereby I
<pb facs="tcp:44368:7"/> have lighted mine: which (for their ſakes in the houſe with me) I thought not meet to lay under a buſhel, but to put it on this meane candlſtick of my making, that they alſo may have light with me. And to this end therfore having thus given account of my purpoſe, take alſo this account of my compoſing this peec, In the pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I have ſeen I confeſs &amp; made much uſe of many commentaries &amp; Catechiſmes, &amp; in this little peice of mine I have ſtudied only plainneſs, without prejudice or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction to any their Authors, enlargeing ſome that were ſome what ſhort, &amp; abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; explaining others long &amp; abſtruſe. It was bad enough when we had a liturgy and Catechiſme in it, a ſet forme both plaine and pithie, enjoyned to be taught children and ſervants: it is now little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, if not worſe, though too much neglected was the powerfull and diligent opening every point and principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion compriſed in that catechiſme: the forme yet then kept us in ſome decorum of knowledge, though for want of due practiſe the power of Godlineſs was much wanting. But now is loſt almoſt both form and power: When though Catechiſmes we have many, yet leaſt <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:44368:8"/> preaching, neglecting catechiſing, makes up a Religion much like that <hi>Nebuchad nezzar's</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 2. 32.</note> Image, that was gold in the head, but in the feet earth. Men and maſters we teach and informe, but children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are neglected. When they that are ſo much for preaching, and cannot away with catechiſing, are ſuch as commonly have more braine then heart, and would be heard more to diſpute, then ſeene to live like Chriſtians. But let both, both preaching and catechiſing be but in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and ſome of the overbuſied time ſpent in the one, ſupply the too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the other: when both young and old may mch grow the better by it. And herein I have endeavoured a peece to that purpoſe, that whoever liſt to ſpare time, (but the too much idle time, ſpent in uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pamphlits, and more idle ſports) to imploy in ſetting this Method a foote, may for the vaine ſervice done to their own luſts and the much pleaſure of mans great foe the <hi>Devill,</hi> do ſervice to their ſouls good, &amp; to the glory of their greateſt friend God. However in this let him have his owne time, betweene whiles both before and after Sermons, when having called thoſe under their charge, to give accompts of their attention at the
<pb facs="tcp:44368:8"/> Church, you may in this edifie them at home, and by little and little the better fit them for Church ſervices: underſtanding the grounds and principles of religion in this plain &amp; familiar manner will they the better underſtand ſermons though delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in more quaint and elegant Phraſes.</p>
            <p>Nor let it be onely the practice of that Gods holy day, a day that he challenges to himſelfe, but otherwiſe having given you ſix dayes to doe your worke in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles even on ſome of theſe, in this duty give him ſome of your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: when he will ſo bleſſe you as that you may the better doe your worke. If a quarter or halfe an houre in a day be ſometimes ſpent in the practice, at the weekes end you will find it no prejudice to your work, but an excellent preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Gods day to do his worke in, who doubtleſſe will thereby both bleſſe and proſper the workes of every your owne dayes.

               <p>When while you are thus teaching them this, by this or the like <hi>Alphabet</hi> here before ſet downe, may you bring them to read, which even naturally is the deſire of moſt: and that which when men come to the knowledge of themſelves and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read, wiſh even too late that they had beſtowed even a great deale more paines and coſt to attaine it, then this timely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour may doe.

Where you muſt firſt give them their names as before annexed to their markes: ſo as when ſeeing any of them the Learner may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44368:21"/> ſay that this <hi>Crooke</hi> (,) is a <hi>Comma,</hi> or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or ſhort point, where is to be made a ſhort ſtop in reading: Theſe <hi>two pricks</hi> (:) a <hi>middle distinction,</hi> where to ſtay a little longer: This one <hi>Pricke</hi> (.) a <hi>full point,</hi> where one may take breath or end a period: This point with a <hi>crooke</hi> over it (?) a note of <hi>Interrogation,</hi> where a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is asked: This point with a <hi>downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right line</hi> over it thus (!) a note of <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> which is but as a ſhort ſtop, and at which the pronunciation muſt be of the words next going before it, as with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

When alſo you may tell them the meaning of thoſe markes at the end of the ſmall letters, as how &amp;. <hi>&amp;.</hi> &amp;. are all but one and the ſame, each anſwering to each ſort of letters, and ſtand for <hi>And,</hi> and is called <hi>and by it ſelfe:</hi> and that ſet with a cafter it as &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is then uſed when any thing remains unſet downe, or is underſtood to follow though not ſet downe, and is called <hi>and the rest,</hi> or <hi>and ſo forth.</hi> As alſo of the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble letters teaching them to know and read them, being that to be thus joyned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44368:22"/> together, they doe ſomewhat differ from the reſt. As alſo in the written Copy to tell them the differences betweene the letters two of a ſort in the Alphabet of ſmall letters: that excepting the two errs (r r) both in print and writing uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, as alſo the eſſes in both the Roman and Italian, this (ſ) is uſed in the beginning or middle, never at the end of a word, and this (s) is promiſcuouſly uſed in all places, beginning, middle, end, as you ſee good) the firſt is ordinarily to be written at the beginning and in the middle of a word, the latter only ſtill at the end of a word. Let them keepe to theſe ſet formes of letters, till they can perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly write according to theſe Coppies in either hands: and then they may eaſily vary and write mixt hand, in ſuch other letters as are uſed in writing, if (though this be enough) they would be further maſters of the Pen.</p>
               <p>This learnt, you may proceed, and ſhew them ſome ſentence or other, or ſome two, three or more ſentences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that have in them all theſe, as that of 1 Kings Chapt.

This let be your practice a while, till they can exactly know and underſtand thus much.</p>
               <p>Then for their firſt exerciſe to read, you may make uſe of that peece of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you thus poſed them in: or chooſe ſome other eaſie and ſhort ſentence, as ſome one or other of them ſet downe in the third page before that Scripture, as, <hi>Come ye children, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Let us heare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>The feare of the Lord is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wiſedome, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When and wherein be not too preſſing to teach them too much at once: nor let them ſhufflle it over by halves.

                     <hi>Catechiſme</hi> is originally a Greek word and ſignifies by word of mouth, by way of queſtion and anſwer the firſt inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or inſtitution of the more ignorant in any kind of doctrine.

                  <p>Many wayes it may be proved: by theſe two eſpecially.

                  <hi>And:</hi> as if to teach us ſtill the damnable nature of ſin, what though ſins paſt may be forgiven, ſins to come may condemn us. And therefore ought we not onely as there in that ſtill to pray the forgiveneſſe of this or that, or all whatever ſins paſt, but as in this we be not more intangled by it in times to come <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 12, 43, 44, 45. Jo. 5. 14.</note>, and ſo our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin procure our further or greater damnation. Which Petition here that ſome make two, may (to me ſeeming) ſeeme to make it but as it were a double ſhaft, or as two darts, which were they three, all were little enough to thruſt through the heart of this rebellious <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi> ſin <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 18, 14,</note>. And both are to this end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and preſcribed by Chriſt, though one be but (as 'twere) the Expoſition of the other.</p>
               <p>To explaine yet further which:</p>
               <p>By <hi>Temptation</hi> meaning all occaſions of ſinning, eſpecially here having reference to ſin ſtill to come: and by <hi>Evil</hi> meaning the whatever ſtill preſent occaſion of it, the whatever preſent ſin, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whatever iſſues of ſinning, the whatever evils come by ſin, as Death, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, War, Sickneſſes, Seditions, ſtrifes, troubles, perſecutions, Death, Hell, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44368:75"/> the like. Which ſin being an enemy ſo importunate, as at every moment to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault us, needs ſtill to oppoſe it this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayer: and that armed with the whole armour of God <note n="e" place="margin">Ep. 6, 13.</note>, againſt thoſe both damnable batteries: Well and how may we have on that armour of God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then by this our prayer, that God will not lead us into the one, but deliver us from the other? that is, that God will not by withdrawing his grace <note n="f" place="margin">Pſ. 51, 11</note>, (his grace that ſhould curbe and prevent our ſin) leave us to the ſwing of our owne luſts, which hurried on by Satan and the world, drives us headlong to damnation <note n="g" place="margin">Jam. 1, 15,</note>: but by his grace <note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note>, deliver us from the whatever aſſaults of it. And as argument of the preſence of that his grace, that we may hate and avoid evill, love and cleave to that ſtill which is good <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 1, 16, 17. 1 Pet. 3, 11,</note>. And both theſe that God ſtill doe for us: not lead <hi>us</hi> into temptation, but deliver <hi>us</hi> from evill: that ſin, Satan, or the World hurt not us nor others.

I am not ignorant that ſet formes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a thing much controverted: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by none that I ever yet could ſpeake with or read of, ſoundly argued as either unlawfull or inexpedient, but rather a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practiſe warrantable from Gods word. Though in theſe latter times much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, and as it were to be caſt out by them Extemporary which Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary votes (though uſefull I confeſſe in a mans private cloſet, and for himſelfe, who himſelfe beſt knowes his one Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies) yet how warrantable in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, I am yet, I alſo confeſſe, to learne. For other diſcourſes, as divine Orations, Homilies, Sermons, or the like, (which few yet are loth rawlie to vent, but by firſt ſome kind of premeditation) I grant yet may be at a mans pleaſure, and as his abilities are, either premeditated or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, he being therein but as a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from God to his people, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe things to their Conſideration: but for prayers, where he is as the mouth of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44368:79"/> the people to God, and is to propoſe not onely his owne, but alſo their requeſts and reſolutions, it might be much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient they pin not their poſitions wholy upon his extemporary verdict, but know alſo in ſome meaſure before hand what they in that his form ſhould pray for, in as much as otherwiſe they may be tied to an implicite Creede, and pray for they know not what. Is it not the mind of Gods ſpirit, that as well as be zealous for God, we be knowing alſo how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that zeale? in as much as even that zeale without this knowledge is by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelfe <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> counted ſcarce commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. When ſurely by the word ought we to trie both, and even before hand ſee not onely in diſcourſe but even in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to, what we meane to produce, that we be ſure it be according to the mind of Gods ſpirit in that word. That to the Apoſtles
<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> when <note n="d" place="margin">verſ. 18.</note> to be led before Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours &amp; Kings for the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it ſhould
<note n="e" place="margin">verſ. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>in that houre</hi> be given them what they ſhould ſpeake, warants not now our whatever Extemporary ſpeaking: That gift was but contemporary with them, the Spirit of God that then ſpake by them, was yet in his worke of the Word the Scriptures, and had not yet by them ſet
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44368:80"/> a period to that worke, as afterwards he did <note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 22. 18, 19.</note> with a Curſe to whoſoever ſhould or add to, or diminiſh from them: Whennow he ſpeaks to us, but in and by thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Were every Extemporary diſcourſe theron now to be accounted his, it is eaſie to gues into what abſurdities we might ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when of Sermons and Commentaries, and Expoſitions on them, pretended as true, are yet we know many heterodox and falſe: and not according to the mind of that Gods Spirit in the ſcriptures. Yea, may I not doubt to ſay that al the Apoſtles ſaid, no nor yet before them, all that the Prophets ſaid, was not of Equall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Scriptures they by the Dictate of Gods holy Spirit left us upon record as a rule to guide our faith by? For what ſaith Saint Paul
<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 7</note>? ſome things he commended as the commands of God
<note n="h" place="margin">verſ. 10.</note>, the Spirit of God ſpeaking by him: ſome things againe he counſels of himſelfe <note n="i" place="margin">verſ. 12.</note>, and as no expreſſe command of God. And beſide that, marke that before cited aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, where it is ſaid it ſhould in that houre be given to the Apoſtles what they ſhould ſpeake: what was it but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that what on their owne behalfe they ſhould anſwer their perſecutours, not what ſhould be the rule of our faith?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44368:80"/> That was not to be committed to the ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie puffes of an extemporary anſwer or promulgation of their ſucceſſours, but to the written word they ſhould leave them. The mind of the Spirit muſt now be made manifeſt by the word of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which only is in and by the ſcriptures. No, no, they truly to me ſeeming do but weakely provide for their ſafeguard that from the ſounder pillars of premeditation will flie to, or leane on that extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But I am not now to argue the point.

So many, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite have been our ſins, that we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven grieved thy good ſpirit of grace, with thoſe ſeducers of old, whatever we have profeſſed as to thee with our words, with our workes yet we have denied thee, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

O how uncleane are we made by ſin! how filthie is even our righteouſneſſe? that even much more loathſome muſt needs be our ſin! how many are the impious inventions we daily plot and practiſe, as if we meant no other then onely to ſtudy how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive even our owne ruine and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

If thou ſhouldeſt lay Judgement to the Line, and righteouſneſſe to the plummets, thou mighteſt make thine anger to ſmoake, thy jealouſie to burne like fire, and all the Curſes that are written in thy book, thou mighteſt lay upon us, and blot out our name from under the Heaven.

Yet O Lord, though to the terror of perverſe and obſtinate ſinners, we know that thou art juſt, yet to the comfort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners we know thou art merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full too.

Haſten O Lord our Repentance! diſſolve our flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hearts into godly ſorrow, and by that happy means work in us that more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py repentance, repentance to ſalvation not to be repented of. When to further both that faith and repentance, inflame our holy zeale of glory: and truly to manage that zeale, endue us with the knowledge of thy will, by the glorious Sun-beames of thy good word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enlighten the eyes of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that we may know thee as we ought

Put us O Lord, in the way of thy truth, and then, Lord, grant us grace happily to perſevere in that way to the end. Let not any the over-ſollicitous cares of earth or earthly things, put over any our care of heaven or the things of heaven: but with our owne eſtate what ere it be, let's learne therewith to be content: if proſperous, to praiſe thee our God for that proſperity, if in adverſity or under the Croſſe, that patiently we may beare it.

               <p>O Eternall, moſt glorious, and moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord God, thou who art rich in mercy, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth! We thine unworthy Servants here proſtrate before the footſtool of thy ſacred Majeſty doe humbly confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our many and manifold ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. As how ſhapen in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and conceived in ſin, when Children bred up altogether in childiſhneſſe, when growing ſtrong, ſtrengthning our ſelves in wickedneſſe, giving up our whole ſelves as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſſe unto ſin: our hearts hardned to ill workes, our underſtandings dulled, our wils refractory, and our whole affections crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: our heads ſet to plotand contrive miſchiefe, our hands to handle iniquity, our tongues to curſing, ſwearing, lying, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and corrupt communication: our eyes to looke upon and behold vanity, our feet
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44368:89"/> ready and ſwift to ſtand in the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to walke in the counſell of the ungodly. So as both within and without, from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot there is no whole part in us, but we are altogether full of putrified ſores, ſores of abominable ſin and wickedneſſe. As to the things of thy ſervice and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of thy glory, how have we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and omitted our almoſt every pious duty! As to our Neighbours good, how intemperate have we beene in pride and envy, in willfullneſſe and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to break all the Chriſtian and godly bands of unity? How have our words, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intentions perverted the better practices both of our ſelves and others? O Lord I what have we not done, but might juſtly draw downe thy vengeance on us? Yet O Lord, there is mercy with thee! As conſequent to this our humble confeſſion, let us implore that mercy, and deſire thine all fatherly goodneſſe, to remove from us thy judgements, and to prevent all further evils that might juſtly come on us for our ſins. Yea and the better to prevent thoſe evils, prevent our ſins: and let us caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us thoſe our beloved, thoſe our darling ſins, to which our perverſe nature is too much prone and inclined. Let no

Let no wandring imaginations ſeduce us, and in thy mercies waſhed let us not relapſe into our old mire of ſin. Let not hereſie, ſchiſme, infidelity, or Apoſtacy blemiſh the truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Let not Wars, Famine, Plague, or ſcarſity blain the happineſſe of our health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proſperity. No, O Lord, let not any evill whither of ſin or puniſhment, impaire or thy glory or our good. Nor is it onely ſin that thus brings us on our knees, or the evill of ſin that requires from us deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of evils: but our parts alſo it is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate thy farther mercies, that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
